# Linear-Regression
This repo is to demonstrate Linear Regression
Regression Analysis with Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates the generation of synthetic regression data using sklearn.datasets.make_regression and explores relationships between features and the target variable using Seaborn's regression plots.

Overview

Generates a dataset with 1000 samples and 10 features using make_regression().

Stores the generated data in a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

Visualizes relationships between each feature and the target using Seaborn's regplot().

Files

p1.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook containing:

Data generation and preprocessing

Regression plots for each feature vs. target

Dependencies


Make sure you have the following installed before running the notebook:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Usage

Open and run p1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Execute the visualization cells to analyze relationships between features and the target.

Modify parameters in make_regression() to experiment with different datasets.
